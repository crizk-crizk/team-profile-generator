# HTML Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that asks the user certain questions about employees of a company in order to generate an HTML webpage displaying each employee's information in a card. The page is styled using Bootstrap, which makes it an appealing and responsive application. In order to make the code maintainable and organized, tests for each employee and individually filed classes have been created. Understanding of Object-Oriented Programming is essential for developing.
